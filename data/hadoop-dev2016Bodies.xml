Hi all,

Thanks to the combined work of many, many contributors, here's an RC0 for
3.0.0-alpha1:

http://home.apache.org/~wang/3.0.0-alpha1-RC0/

alpha1 is the first in a series of planned alpha releases leading up to GA.
The objective is to get an artifact out to downstreams for testing and to
iterate quickly based on their feedback. So, please keep that in mind when
voting; hopefully most issues can be addressed by future alphas rather than
future RCs.

Sorry for getting this out on a Tuesday, but I'd still like this vote to
run the normal 5 days, thus ending Saturday (9/3) at 9AM PDT. I'll extend
if we lack the votes.

Please try it out and let me know what you think.

Best,
Andrew

Thanks Andrew for the great work! It's really exciting to finally see a
Hadoop 3 RC.

I noticed CHANGES and RELEASENOTES markdown files which were not in
previous RCs like 2.7.3. What are good tools to verify them? I tried
reading them on IntelliJ but format looks odd.

I'm still testing the RC:
- Downloaded and verified checksum
- Built from source
- Will start small cluster and test simple programs, focusing on EC
functionalities

	The site tarball has them converted to HTML.  I've also re-run the versions that I \
keep on my gitlab account.  (Since the data comes from JIRA, the content should be \
the same but the format and ordering might be different since I use the master branch \
of Yetus.) https://gitlab.com/_a__w_/eco-release-metadata/tree/master/HADOOP/3.0.0-alpha1


	It also looks like IntelliJ has a few different markdown plug-ins.  You'll want one \
that supports what is generally referred to as MultiMarkdown or Github-Flavored \
Markdown (GFM) since releasedocmaker uses the table extension format found in that \
specification.  (It's an extremely common extension so I'm sure one of them supports \
                it.)

I don't know why my email client keeps getting rid of all of my spacing. Resending \
the same email so that it is actually legible...

I did find one odd thing, though. It could be a misconfiguration on my system, but \

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks to the combined work of many, many contributors, here's an RC0 for
&gt; &gt; 3.0.0-alpha1:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://home.apache.org/~wang/3.0.0-alpha1-RC0/
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; alpha1 is the first in a series of planned alpha releases leading up to
&gt; &gt; GA.
&gt; &gt; The objective is to get an artifact out to downstreams for testing and to
&gt; &gt; iterate quickly based on their feedback. So, please keep that in mind when
&gt; &gt; voting; hopefully most issues can be addressed by future alphas rather
&gt; &gt; than
&gt; &gt; future RCs.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sorry for getting this out on a Tuesday, but I'd still like this vote to
&gt; &gt; run the normal 5 days, thus ending Saturday (9/3) at 9AM PDT. I'll extend
&gt; &gt; if we lack the votes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please try it out and let me know what you think.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Andrew

Hi Eric, thanks for trying this out,

I tried this gpg command to get my key, seemed to work:

Well that's embarrassing. I had accidentally slightly renamed my log4j.properties \
file in my conf directory, so it was there, just not being read. Apologies for the \
unnecessary spam. With this and the public key from Andrew, I give my non-binding +1. \

	Nah.  You were just testing out the shell rewrite's ability to detect a common \
error. ;) 

	BTW, something else.. instead of doing env|grep HADOOP, you can do 'hadoop envvars' \
                to get most of the good stuff.

+1 (non-binding)

Did the following on 7 RHEL 6.6 servers
- Downloaded and built from source
- Downloaded and verified checksum of the binary tar.gz file
- Setup a cluster with 1 NN and 6 DNs
- Tried regular HDFS commands
- Tried EC commands (listPolicies, getPolicy, setPolicy), they work fine
- Verified that with a 3-2 policy, 1.67x capacity is used. Below is the
output after copying the binary tar.gz file into an EC folder. The file is
318MB.

Configured Capacity: 3221225472 (3 GB)
Present Capacity: 3215348743 (2.99 GB)
DFS Remaining: 2655666176 (2.47 GB)
DFS Used: 559682567 (533.75 MB)

Thanks Allen for clarifying on the markdown files. I also verified the site
html files (content of the index.html, randomly selected some links).

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks Andrew for the great work! It's really exciting to finally see a
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hadoop 3 RC.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I noticed CHANGES and RELEASENOTES markdown files which were not in
&gt;&gt; &gt; previous RCs like 2.7.3. What are good tools to verify them? I tried
&gt;&gt; &gt; reading them on IntelliJ but format looks odd.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm still testing the RC:
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Downloaded and verified checksum
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Built from source
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Will start small cluster and test simple programs, focusing on EC
&gt;&gt; &gt; functionalities
&gt;&gt; &gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks to the combined work of many, many contributors, here's an RC0

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; alpha1 is the first in a series of planned alpha releases leading up to

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The objective is to get an artifact out to downstreams for testing and

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for getting this out on a Tuesday, but I'd still like this vote to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; run the normal 5 days, thus ending Saturday (9/3) at 9AM PDT. I'll

pseudo cluster, and ran a few of the sample jobs.

Thanks a lot for doing all this release work, Andrew.

- Built from source
- Verified LICENSE and NOTICE are correctly contained in the jars built
- Started pseudo-distributed HDFS, verified basic operations work.
- Started KMS service, verified basic KMS operations work, a simple
encryption zone works.
- Sanity checked NN webui.

Best,

Steve requested a git hash for this release. This led us into a brief
discussion of our use of git tags, wherein we realized that although
release tags are immutable (start with "rel/"), RC tags are not. This is
based on the HowToRelease instructions.

I asked in infra.chat about this, and filed a JIRA per their request. I'll
update the tags and release instructions once we have guidance.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-12552

For now though, here's the tag I pushed (email is immutable):

object a990d2ebcd6de5d7dc2d3684930759b0f0ea4dc3
type commit
tag release-3.0.0-alpha1-RC0

That's an easy change to create-release.

Good point Allen, I forgot about `hadoop version`. Since it's populated by
a version-info.properties file, people can always cat that file.

Thanks for making this forward hardly, Andrew!

In fact, I hit an error similar to Eric's one regardless of
configuring yarn.app.mapreduce.am.env and mapreduce.admin.user.env...
does anyone hit same error?

&gt; Thanks to the combined work of many, many contributors, here's an RC0 for
&gt; 3.0.0-alpha1:
&gt; 
&gt; http://home.apache.org/~wang/3.0.0-alpha1-RC0/
&gt; 
&gt; alpha1 is the first in a series of planned alpha releases leading up to GA.
&gt; The objective is to get an artifact out to downstreams for testing and to
&gt; iterate quickly based on their feedback. So, please keep that in mind when
&gt; voting; hopefully most issues can be addressed by future alphas rather than
&gt; future RCs.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for getting this out on a Tuesday, but I'd still like this vote to
&gt; run the normal 5 days, thus ending Saturday (9/3) at 9AM PDT. I'll extend
&gt; if we lack the votes.
&gt; 
&gt; Please try it out and let me know what you think.
&gt;

* Compiling source code.
* Verified checksums.
* Running RM-HA cluster with ZooKeeper 3.4.8 and ran MR job with
native libraries. It worked well.

Again, I'm very happy to move 3.0.0 release forward :-)
Thanks, Andrew!

FYI:

&gt; In fact, I hit an error similar to Eric's one regardless of
configuring yarn.app.mapreduce.am.env and mapreduce.admin.user.env...
does anyone hit same error?

This was because of completely my wrong configuration. Please ignore this.

Best,

Hi all,

Thanks to the combined work of many, many contributors, here's an RC0 for
3.0.0-alpha1:

http://home.apache.org/~wang/3.0.0-alpha1-RC0/

alpha1 is the first in a series of planned alpha releases leading up to GA.
The objective is to get an artifact out to downstreams for testing and to
iterate quickly based on their feedback. So, please keep that in mind when
voting; hopefully most issues can be addressed by future alphas rather than
future RCs.

Sorry for getting this out on a Tuesday, but I'd still like this vote to
run the normal 5 days, thus ending Saturday (9/3) at 9AM PDT. I'll extend
if we lack the votes.

Please try it out and let me know what you think.

Best,
Andrew

Thanks everyone for voting and helping to validate alpha1. The VOTE closes
with 16 +1s, 6 of them binding PMC votes, and no -1s.

I'll go ahead and wrap up the release, will send an announcement out likely
tomorrow once the mirrors have caught up.

Best,
Andrew
