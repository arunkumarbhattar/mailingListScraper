I used a symlink here to try and duplicate the original problem case that a git user \
at Intel brought to me.  I admit I didn't consider the problem of testing on \
platforms without symlink support.

I'm having a little difficulty generating a rename/add conflict inside this test \
without using a symlink, which seems odd to me as the symlink doesn't seem to be \
necessary in an experiment I did by hand.  I'll either re-submit with this portion of \
the test conditional on symlink support, or with an alternate test that doesn't use \
symlinks (if I can get that to work in the test).
