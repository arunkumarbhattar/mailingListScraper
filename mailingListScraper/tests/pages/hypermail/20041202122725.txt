I bet zone-&gt;all_unreclaimable is one of the main issues here as Andrea notes.<br>

&gt;<i> Thomas, could you please put together a description of how to reproduce</i><br>

A simple &quot;fillmem&quot; works for me - the OOM killer kills the hog and the bash <br>
which its being ran from. Have you tried that? <br>
<br>
If you fire up a few fillmem's at the same time I bet you'll see the problem in a <br>
greater degree.<br>
