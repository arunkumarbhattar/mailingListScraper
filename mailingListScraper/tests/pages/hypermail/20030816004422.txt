Almost all of this was in the first locking patch, which was probably<br>
shorter than this description.<br>

Agreed, will add to my list.<br>

Ok, well this piece remains oopsable by inspection, though it is root<br>
only. See free_entropy_store:<br>
<br>
        if (r->pool)<br>
                kfree(r->pool);<br>
        kfree(r);<br>
<br>
..while r and r->pool are potentially being used concurrently.<br>

Ok. I've significantly improved the instrumentation and will be happy<br>
to post test cases along with my next fixes too. All the controversial<br>
things are at the end of my queue, as well (the present controversy<br>
was not about something I'd submitted for inclusion). <br>
<br>
If anyone's interested, I have a preliminary Debian package for NIST's<br>
RNG statistical test suite too (though this is only good as a sanity<br>
check).<br>

I can probably break this into a bunch of pieces if the two its<br>
already in don't seem obvious enough on their own.<br>
