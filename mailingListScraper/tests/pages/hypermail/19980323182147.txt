<i>&gt; What NETBEUI does is take reasonable NETBIOS packets and encapsulates</i><br>
<i>&gt; them inside the BROADCAST packets shown above. Now you get 1500-byte</i><br>
<i>&gt; packets that are received by everybody on the LAN. Everybody gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupted and has to throw the stuff away. This is a real CPU-Cycle</i><br>
<i>&gt; sink.</i><br>

No - only datagram group target messages are sent broadcast and control<br>
stuff. See the IBM networking technical reference<br>
