While working on a system to make these mailing archives scale more<br>
effecitvely I accidently destroyed the current set of archives (ah<br>
whoops). <br>
 <br>
This collection should build quickly. This new method should load pages<br>
faster and keep them in a logical monthly order. It also includes text<br>
archiving of the messages which can be found at the following URL:<br>

Sorry for the inconvenience.<br>
