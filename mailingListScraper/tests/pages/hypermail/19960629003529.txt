Aw Jeez,<br>
    I'd only just gotten over that and you had to remind me! <sigh> :-)<br>
<p>
    A touch more seriously, that reminds me of a couple of wonderful Apollo<br>
features that I'd love to see in Linux. Those features are variant links<br>
and extended pathnames.<br>
<p>
    For those who've never had the privilege of working on an Apollo<br>
system, a variant link is a symbolic link with an embedded environment<br>
variable reference:<br>
<p>
        ln -s "/usr/${BINARY_FORMAT}/lib" /usr/lib<br>
<p>
would make /usr/lib a link to either /usr/aout/lib or /usr/elf/lib<br>
depending on the value of the environment variable BINARY_FORMAT at the<br>
time the link is dereferenced. This was used on Apollo systems to support<br>
three operating environments: Domain/OS, BSD4.3 and SYS5.3 all at the same<br>
time. /bin was a variant link depending on the value of SYSTYPE. This was<br>
incredibly useful! One use I can see for it immediately is to have<br>
/usr/src/linux be a link to the source of the currently executing kernel.<br>
Trivial with variant links. Anyone interested in building it?<br>
<p>
    The other feature that was really handy was extended pathnames. This<br>
related to the Apollo's typed filesystem. A filesystem object had a<br>
particular type with an associated type manager (essentially a library to<br>
handle the typical file operations). A type manager could accept additional<br>
filename components beyond the name of the actual file, i.e. a file called<br>
/usr/foo could be openned as /usr/foo/bar. The type manager would be<br>
responsible for doing something meaningful based on the extra components.<br>
One system that used this extensively was the Domain Software Engineering<br>
Environment (DSEE). DSEE provided version control (among other things). A<br>
file under DSEE control could be referred to as: .../library/file to refer<br>
to the latest version of the file or as .../library/file/revision to refer<br>
to a particular revision of the file. This made it really easy to do things<br>
like fetch the versions of all files that were used to build a particular<br>
release, etc.<br>
<p>
    Anyhow, we're all talking about post 2.0 wish lists, these two items<br>
are on my wish list. Variant links would be great, extended pathnames would<br>
be totally cool. For that matter something like the type manager system<br>
would be simply amazing.<br>
<p>
        Cheers,<br>
