&gt;<i> OK.  There was no description of all this in your initial patch, so I don't</i><br>

<br>
Almost all of this was in the first locking patch, which was probably<br>
shorter than this description.<br>

&gt;<i> &gt;  [By the way, whoever did the workqueue conversion for 2.5 changed this</i><br>

&gt;<i> </i><br>
&gt;<i> That would have been me.  The context switch rate due to</i><br>

Agreed, will add to my list.<br>

&gt;<i> &gt; f) change_poolsize (queued for resend)</i><br>
&gt;<i> </i><br>
&gt;<i> Queued for resend because I just didn't know what to do with the patches.</i><br>
&gt;<i> </i><br>
&gt;<i> I do not understand the random driver, and judging from the past couple of</i><br>

<br>
Ok, well this piece remains oopsable by inspection, though it is root<br>
only. See free_entropy_store:<br>
<br>
        if (r-&gt;pool)<br>
                kfree(r-&gt;pool);<br>
        kfree(r);<br>
<br>
..while r and r-&gt;pool are potentially being used concurrently.<br>
<br>
&gt;<i> And, to add to my dilemma, the random driver is security-related and</i><br>
&gt;<i> something which scary propellor-headed types get all emotional about :)</i><br>
&gt;<i></i><br>
&gt;<i> So getting these changes in will be hard.  It would help a lot if they</i><br>
&gt;<i> could be presented individually and that Ted, Jamie and/or other interested</i><br>
&gt;<i> parties were to review and ack them.</i><br>
<br>
Ok. I've significantly improved the instrumentation and will be happy<br>
to post test cases along with my next fixes too. All the controversial<br>
things are at the end of my queue, as well (the present controversy<br>
was not about something I'd submitted for inclusion). <br>
<br>
If anyone's interested, I have a preliminary Debian package for NIST's<br>
RNG statistical test suite too (though this is only good as a sanity<br>
check).<br>
 <br>
&gt;<i> &gt; g) urandom starves/races random (queued for resend)</i><br>
&gt;<i> </i><br>
&gt;<i> hrm.  That's one which I actually understood.  There is yet hope.</i><br>
<br>
I can probably break this into a bunch of pieces if the two its<br>
already in don't seem obvious enough on their own.<br>
